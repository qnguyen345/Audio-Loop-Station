# Ostinato Live - Audio Loop Station
Ostinato Live is an audio looping program that lets musicians create multi-layered live musical performances. By recording short, repeating tracks that can be layered, copied, and modified, a single musician can create a complex musical composition.

Each loop, consisting of an arbitrary number of tracks, can be created and saved during a performance or ahead of time, then loaded for seamless, uninterrupted playback.

The straightforward and intuitive user interface ensures basic functionality can be easily accessed. At the same time, the graphical user interface allows for additional features that are not possible with traditional pedal-based options.

## Installation Guide

**macOS**
1) Create a virtual environment:<br> ```python3 -m venv venv```
2) Activate virtual environment:<br>```source venv/bin/activate```
3) Install dependecies from requirements.txt: <br>```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4) Run the app by running: <br>```python3 launch.py```

**Windows**
1) Create a virtual environment:<br> ```python3 -m venv venv```
3) Activate virtual environment:<br>```venv\Scripts\activate```
4) Install dependecies from requirements.txt: <br>```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
6) Run the app by running: <br>```python3 launch.py```

After running ```python3 launch.py``` in the terminal, the app will automatically launch in an external window, and users do not need to enter a URL as the app will open directly in the WebKit-based window. The app is configured to run on localhost:8050.
